	abstract = {In this paper, we describe a novel approach to understand and explain news spreading dynamics on Twitter by using well-known epidemic models. Our underlying hypothesis is that the information diffusion on Twitter is analogous to the spread of a disease. As mathematical epidemiology has been extensively studied, being able to express news spreading as an epidemic model enables us to use a wide range of tools and procedures which have been proven to be both analytically rich and operationally useful. To further emphasize this point, we also show how we can readily use one of such tools - a procedure for detection of influenza epidemics, to detect change of trend dynamics on Twitter.},

	issn = {0921-8009},
	abstract = {Agriculture continues to be a major contributor to water pollution, climate change and loss of biodiversity although policies to encourage farmers to work to higher sustainability standards in food and energy crop production have increased throughout the European Union. In New Member States, accession to the European Union mostly brought a substantially increased public support to foster the diffusion of certified organic farming. However, the take-up of organic farming is varied for reasons that are not yet well understood. In this paper, we analyse the diffusion of organic farming through farm populations. This involves an understanding of farmer behaviour and how it can change over time. We present a generic agent based model that builds on the Theory of Planned Behaviour as framework for understanding and modelling farmers' decision-making processes. The model is applied to high-diffusion regions in two New EU Member States, Latvia and Estonia. The values for the model's parameters are informed by survey data. The model reproduces the interdependence of social influence and economic factors. Social influence alone is shown to make little difference to the model dynamics; organic farmers remain organic, and conventional farmers remain conventional. Introducing a change to the environment (e.g. a subsidy) results in an increase in the proportion of adopters. Thus, economic factors appear to be more influential than social factors. However, only when allowing for both, the subsidy and social influence, do we reveal the whole picture and the combined adoption rate is higher than the sum of the proportion of adopters resulting from just social influence (without a subsidy) and from just a subsidy (without social influence). We also compare the effect of the subsidy with the effect of influence from organic farm advisors to develop policy recommendations.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of innovation diffusion has attracted strong academic interest since the early 1960s. Traditional diffusion models have aimed at empirical generalizations and hence describe the spread of new products parsimoniously at the market level. More recently, agent-based modeling and simulation has increasingly been adopted since it operates on the individual level and, thus, can capture complex emergent phenomena highly relevant in diffusion research. Agent-based methods have been applied in this context both as intuition aids that facilitate theory-building and as tools to analyze real-world scenarios, support management decisions and obtain policy recommendations. This review addresses both streams of research. We critically examine the strengths and limitations of agent-based modeling in the context of innovation diffusion, discuss new insights agent-based models have provided, and outline promising opportunities for future research. The target audience of the paper includes both researchers in marketing interested in new findings from the agent-based modeling literature and researchers who intend to implement agent-based models for their own research endeavors. Accordingly, we also cover pivotal modeling aspects in depth (concerning, e.g., consumer adoption behavior and social influence) and outline existing models in sufficient detail to provide a proper entry point for researchers new to the field.},

	volume = {16},
	shorttitle = {Why people use social media},
	abstract = {Social media is a critical area of interest for marketing scholars and practitioners. Recent research has shown that 88\% of marketers are using social media and that they are spending over \$60 billion annually on social media advertising (Gil-Or, 2010; Smith, 2011). Successfully making contact with consumers via social media is predicted to show great returns for marketers in the coming years (Okazaki, Katsukura, \& Nishiyama, 2007). Despite the importance of social media, there is little understanding of how and why consumers use social media. 
Uses and gratifications theory, which has its roots in the communications literature, can be an integral part of developing better scales and measurement instruments for social media marketers. The basic premise of uses and gratifications theory is that individuals seek out media that fulfill their needs and leads to ultimate gratification (Lariscy, Tinkham, \& Sweetser, 2011). Uses and gratifications theory has specific relevance to social media, but it has not been given prominence in the marketing and social media literature. Therefore this paper seeks to apply uses and gratifications theory to help explain why consumers use social media. In particular, this research seeks to (1) demonstrate the importance of uses and gratifications theory to social media, (2) to apply uses and gratifications theory to social media, and (3) to identify the uses and gratifications that consumers receive from using social media. By applying uses and gratifications theory, this research seeks to provide a better and more comprehensive understanding of why consumers use social media.
We begin by briefly summarizing the literature on social media and uses and gratifications theory. Next, we describe the methodology used and the research findings. Last, the article discusses the implications and conclusions of the current research.},

As an example case, the diffusion of three water-related innovations in Southern Germany was chosen. The model represents a real geographic area and simulates the diffusion of showerheads, toilet flushes, and rain-harvesting systems. Agents are households of certain lifestyles, as represented by the Sinus-Milieus® from commercial marketing. Agents use two different kinds of decision rules to decide upon adoption or rejection of the modeled innovations: A cognitively demanding deliberate decision rule and a very simple decision heuristic. Thus, the model integrates concepts of bounded rationality. The overall framework for decision-making is the Theory of Planned Behavior, which has been elaborated using innovation characteristics from diffusion research. The model was calibrated with empirical data stemming from a questionnaire survey and validated against independent data. Scenarios for the nearer future show that water-saving innovations will diffuse even without further promotion, and different promotion strategies that relate specifically to both innovations and lifestyles can be pointed out.},

Firms are utilizing social media channels for communicating their sustainability-related initiatives. The role of social media as a mode for sustainability-related communication by firms has not been widely analyzed in the extant information systems literature. Given the increasingly important role of social media for information diffusion as well as increasing awareness for sustainability practices, this is a critical area of research. In this paper, we use an analytic model to theorize, coupled with empirical analysis to test the impact of firms’ sustainability practices. We have validated our proposed hypotheses using an empirical model based on panel data of firms’ sustainability performance and their Twitter communication over a 3-year period. Through our unique mixed-method study, we add additional methodological rigour to extant social media-based research in the information systems domain. Our research has significant theoretical and managerial significance as we identify how firms utilize social media for sustainability-related communication and its corresponding impact on customer response. Our research provides actionable insights for policymakers, firms as well as investors and consumers on understanding and managing sustainability-related communications on social media.},

In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

In this paper, we present our observations of the microblogging phenomena by studying the topological and geographical properties of Twitter's social network. We find that people use microblogging to talk about their daily activities and to seek or share information. Finally, we analyze the user intentions associated at a community level and show how users with similar intentions connect with each other.},

By applying these morphological operators, it is possible to simplify the social network and thus identify important communities and actors in the network. An analysis based on the visualization of the communities was carried out to verify the pertinence of the detection and simplification.},

On the other hand, academic literature needs to explain this phenomenon fully. The purpose of this study is to understand the role of social media influencers in social interaction and their implications for purchasing decisions for cosmetic products to provide an overview of companies in making business decisions using Instagram. The research employs agent-based modeling simulation (ABM), a combination of a deductive approach using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and an inductive practice through observation. The number of posts, the number of likes and comments, the number of followers, attractiveness of influencers utilize. These parameters lead to purchasing decisions, which subsequently identify with sales figures. This study categorizes three influencers with different characteristics. The simulation results show that influencer [B] sales are the highest with repeated iterations, then influencer [A] and influencer [C] with several parameters that explain the phenomenon of social media influencers in purchasing decisions. Another discovery was that the parameter quantity of content has the most significant influence on buying decisions, followed by other parameters that also contribute significantly. To provide businesses the chance to consider these factors when selecting the right blend of social media influencers to aid product sales.},

By incorporating social network analysis with the support of other statistical methods, we found that opinion leadership was the strongest factor predicting news sharing, followed by news preference and tie strength. Notably, we looked into the phenomenon of homophily at the network and individual levels. While homophily existed at the network level, such similarity actually hampered news sharing in users' local networks. Implications of our work are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper was is to present a model of innovation diffusion process applicable for analysis of innovation in social networking. Until recently, the innovation diffusion was measured by the rate of adoption expressed by the number of adopters versus time or by penetration rate within given population. On the basis of literature review and available empirical data, a new, additional dimension called “interactivity level” is proposed in this paper. It is specific to innovations in social networking, where the main purpose of innovation is to improve interactive contacts among actors in a network. The interactivity level reflects amount of active knowledge and effective use of social media/technologies. This dimension has not been systematically studied yet. However, some recent surveys of social media users demonstrate a need and suggest application of that dimension. It is possible to improve evaluation of diffusion of innovation in social networking by introducing a scale of interactivity level, expressed by the mode/scope and intensity of interactive contacts among users of different social media. Such approach implies that adoption of innovation should not be viewed just as an event but rather as a learning process of each adopter. Hence, some phases of that process need to be identified and assessed in terms of dynamics of learning. Six basic phases of this process are proposed in this paper. Comparative study of average interactivity levels of users in different countries is proposed as an indicator of evolution of social media in the global business environment.},

The present study also examines the mediation effect of consumer attitude between the psychological and technical factors of smartwatches and behavioral intention. We have gathered data from 291 actual smartwatch users. Partial-Least-Squares Structural Equation Modelling and Importance-Performance Analysis (IMPA) were used to analyze the data. The results reveal that both psychological and technical attributes play a key role in affecting consumers’ behavioral intention, in which attitude mediates this relationship. Moreover, among the predictor variables, compatibility is most significant in terms of explaining behavioral intention to use smartwatches, whereas curiosity and complexity have the highest performance index.},

	abstract = {Technology adoption in low-income regions is among the key challenges facing international development projects. Nearly 40\% of the world's population relies on open fires and rudimentary cooking devices exacerbating health outcomes, deforestation, and climatic impacts of inefficient biomass burning. Clean technology alternatives such as clean cookstoves are among the most challenging technologies to approach their target goals through sustainable adoption due to a lack of systematic market-driven design for adoption. Thus, a method is needed to provide insight regarding how target customers evaluate and perceive causes for adopting a clean technology. The holistic approach of this study captures technology adoption through lenses of social networks, individual and society scale beliefs, and rational decision-making behavior. Based on the data collected in the Apac region in Northern Uganda, an agent-based model is developed to simulate emerging adoption behavior in a community. Then, four different scenarios investigate how adoption patterns change due to the potential changes in technology or intervention strategy. These scenarios include influence of stove malfunctions, price elasticity, information campaigns, and strength of a social network. Results suggest that higher adoption rates are achievable if designed technologies are more durable, information campaigns provide realistic expectations for users, policymakers, and education programs work toward women's empowerment, and communal social ties are recognized for influence maximization. The application of this study provides insight for technology designers, project implementers, and policymakers to update their practices for achieving sustainable and to the scale clean technology adoption rates.},

To cope with this issue, diverse policy measures have been implemented to promote farming practices that favour water quality. Among these measures, many instruments are based on the voluntary commitments of farmers. Farmers'’ participation is therefore important for water quality outcomes. To analyse this issue, we built an agent-based model of a drinking water catchment area using the social–ecological systems framework and the theory of planned behaviour. This model aims to better understand the impact of behavioural dynamics on the effectiveness and efficiency of policies targeting water pollution. Our model allows us to explore how the evolution of farming practices is influenced by, first, the behavioural characteristics of farmers and, second, the characteristics of the policy measures implemented. Our main results are threefold: 1) The characteristics of farmers influence policy effectiveness and efficiency; 2) taking into account farmers' behavioural characteristics in the definition of policies may improve the efficiency of policies; and 3) in situations where behavioural characteristics are unknown, policies combining both financial incentives and training measures are costlier but may be a better option than policies relying on a single measure.},

	abstract = {The expansion of irrigated agriculture and recurrent drought periods poses a serious threat to the renewability and sustainability of common water resources in arid and semi-arid regions. These shared resources can take the form of dam water which is shared between farmers according to a predefined schedule or groundwater which the farmers independently extract. The dam water is less expensive to use but this source can be limited in drought years risking crop productivity. Groundwater is a more reliable resource but is more expensive to extract and can cause soil salinity. Simulating agricultural management systems requires understanding and quantifying how biophysical and socio-economical constraints influence the decisions of farmers. Therefore, this research aimed to develop an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach to simulate farmer behaviour in irrigation management. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was used as a theoretical framework to simulate decision models that were integrated with a biophysical model describing the interaction of farmers with water resources and how limitations of water resources and salinity impact crop yield. Through modelling, we explore various strategies to improve sustainable water use. The methodology is applied to an irrigated perimeter of Al Haouz Basin, Morocco, as a case study, where there are different stakeholders and water user associations with conflicting objectives. The ABMs were parameterised using data collected by surveying 70 farmers. The findings indicate that the existing irrigation scheduling was usually satisfactory. However, with the exacerbation of drought periods, the use of dam water resources is unreliable. Farmers responded by seeking alternative water resources and changing their irrigation systems and cropping patterns which led to the potential of overexploitation of groundwater and increased accumulated salt content.},

In our model, each individual plays a coordination game with its neighbors and decides what alternative product to adopt to maximize its payoff. As products are used in conjunction with others and through repeated interactions, individuals are more interested in their long-term benefits and often tend to show trustworthiness to others in order to maximize their long-term payoffs. To capture such trustworthy behavior, we deviate from the expected utility theory and use a new notion of rationality based on the limited-trust equilibrium. By incorporating such rational behavior into the product diffusion model, we analyze the convergence of emerging dynamics to their equilibrium points using a mean-field approximation. In particular, we study the convergence rate of the diffusion process using the absorption probability and the expected absorption time of a reduced-size Markov chain. Simulation shows that when individuals behave trustworthily, their long-term payoffs will increase significantly compared to the case when they are solely self-interested.},

Agent-based modelling has emerged as a useful technique to model and study processes of innovation diffusion within artificial societies, as it allows to easily programme and simulate the interaction of multiple agents among them and with their environment. Despite a large body of literature dealing with innovation of diffusions, including the use of agent-based modelling, there has been little to no consideration of two elements that are important features of consumption: the presence of multiple characteristics of goods, and that of price-premiums on the presence of added characteristics. We propose an agent-based model of the diffusion of such goods, and study its emerging properties when compared to standard ones. Our goal is to try and understand how social interaction affects the consumption of goods that are complex rather than uni-dimensional, and whose prices depend on the number of dimensions (characteristics) that are present. Testing the model for different parameters shows that as goods become more complex, social interaction becomes an increasingly important explanatory variable for purchases. This opens up interesting avenues of discussion for those seeking to bring together innovation diffusion theories and goods’ complexity, and can be linked with a number of issues in the social and sustainability sciences.},

	abstract = {As the possibility of sharing inaccurate information on social media increases markedly during the health crisis, there is a need to develop an understanding of social media users’ motivations for online sharing of information related to major public health challenges such as COVID-19. This study utilised an online survey based on Theory of Planned Behaviour and Diffusion of Innovation Theory to examine how the behavioural intention to share COVID-19-related content on social media is impacted and to develop a model of health information sharing. Results indicate that opinion leadership, beliefs held towards the source of the information, and peers’ influence serve as determinants of the intention to share COVID-19-related information on social media, while the opinion-seeking attitude does not, which could be explained by opinion seekers’ inherent tendency to seek more sources to verify new information obtained. The study contributes to the Information Science field by addressing the previously under-researched area and proposing a new model that explains the impact of the factors on behavioural intention to share health-related information during the health crisis in the online network environment.},

The proposed theoretical model consists of the celebrity type as the independent variable, social presence as the mediator and self-discrepancy as the moderator. Design/methodology/approach A randomized two-group comparison (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) between-subjects experiment (n=104) was conducted. Findings The results indicate that consumers exposed to Instagram celebrity’s brand posts perceive the source to be more trustworthy, show more positive attitude toward the endorsed brand, feel stronger social presence and feel more envious of the source than those consumers exposed to traditional celebrity’s brand posts. Structural equation modeling (Mplus 8.0) and bootstrap confidence intervals indicate that social presence mediates the causal effects of celebrity type on trustworthiness, brand attitude and envy. Multiple regression analyses reveal the moderating effects of appearance-related actual–ideal self-discrepancy. Practical implications Ultimately, managerial implications for social media marketing and Instagram influencer-based branding are provided. From the perspective of marketing planning, the findings speak to the power of influencer marketing as an effective branding strategy.

On the other hand, academic literature needs to explain this phenomenon fully. The purpose of this study is to understand the role of social media influencers in social interaction and their implications for purchasing decisions for cosmetic products to provide an overview of companies in making business decisions using Instagram. The research employs agent-based modeling simulation (ABM), a combination of a deductive approach using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and an inductive practice through observation. The number of posts, the number of likes and comments, the number of followers, attractiveness of influencers utilize. These parameters lead to purchasing decisions, which subsequently identify with sales figures. This study categorizes three influencers with different characteristics. The simulation results show that influencer [B] sales are the highest with repeated iterations, then influencer [A] and influencer [C] with several parameters that explain the phenomenon of social media influencers in purchasing decisions. Another discovery was that the parameter quantity of content has the most significant influence on buying decisions, followed by other parameters that also contribute significantly. To provide businesses the chance to consider these factors when selecting the right blend of social media influencers to aid product sales.},

	abstract = {Social media platforms have a developing role in how people respond to hazards, providing a network to seek help and respond to help requests. Understanding the dynamics of behavior on social media networks can improve community-level hazard response efforts. People who experience damages may use social media to seek immediate help for debris removal, supplies delivery or emergency rescue, and peers connected on social media may respond by reposting the help request or providing help in person. This research develops an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate a community of individuals that use social media to seek help and respond to requests for help during a hurricane. Agents represent individuals that are in a community affected by a hurricane and share a social media network. Behavioral rules for seeking help and providing help are developed using the Theory of Planned Behavior and parametrized through analysis of a survey of social media use conducted in communities that were affected by 2018 Hurricanes Florence and Michael. The ABM simulates agents that post help requests, repost help requests, provide help in person, and receive help. A Design of Experiments approach is applied to assess how ABM parameters, including community size, connectivity of a network, damage rate, and propensity for using social media, influence the number of requests for help that are met through the social media network. Results demonstrate that high connectivity leads to rapid reposting and results in cascading responses to meet requests for help.},

	abstract = {Die zunehmende Virtualisierung von gesellschaftlichen Sozialstrukturen durch den Social Media Bereich und insbesondere durch die virtuellen sozialen Netzwerke stellt die Marketingforschung vor neue Herausforderungen. Aufgrund der technologischen Entwicklung des Web 2.0 entstehen für Konsumenten schnelle und einfache Kommunikations- und Interaktionsmöglichkeiten zum Erfahrungsaustausch über die Produkte und Dienstleistungen eines Unternehmens. Innerhalb eines virtuellen sozialen Netzwerkes existieren Influentials, die aufgrund ihrer kommunikativen Verhaltensweisen und der netzwerkstrukturellen Einbettung eine einzigartige soziale Beeinflussungsfähigkeit aufweisen. Für das Marketing der Unternehmen stellen das Verständnis über die sozialen Beeinflussungsprozesse und die Identifikation der Influentials die zentralen Erfolgsfaktoren dar, um die Konsumenteninteraktion im Sinne der Unternehmenszielsetzung zu beeinflussen. Bisherige Analyse- bzw. Identifikationsmethoden für diese Influentials vernachlässigen jedoch die bedeutsame interpersonelle Perspektive. Die netzwerkstrukturelle Einbettung der Konsumenten bzw. Individuen sowie deren Kommunikations- und Interaktionsprozesse untereinander führen zu einem dynamischen, nichtlinearen und komplexen Sozialsystem. Bei der Untersuchung dieser Dynamiken stoßen traditionelle Analysemethoden der Marketingforschung an ihre Grenzen. Deshalb entwickelt der Verfasser ein agentenbasiertes Simulationsmodell, um das individuelle Konsumentenhalten als komplexes und dynamisches System abzubilden. Die Simulationsergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die Influentials weder über eine strukturell besonders bedeutsame Position innerhalb des Netzwerkes verfügen, noch eine erhöhte soziale Aktivität aufweisen. Die bisher verwendeten Verfahren der strukturellen sozialen Netzwerkanalyse und der sozialen Aktivitätsanalyse sind deshalb nur eingeschränkt zur Identifikation von Influentials geeignet. Aus einer interpersonellen Analyseperspektive zeigt sich, dass die Influentials eine besonders hohe wahrgenommene Glaubwürdigkeit aufweisen und das soziale Umfeld dieser Individuen durch eine hohe Empfänglichkeit für soziale Beeinflussungen gekennzeichnet ist. Die agentenbasierte Simulation erweitert somit das Verständnis über das sozial beeinflusste Konsumentenverhalten und liefert damit wertvolle Hinweise für die praxisnahe Identifikation von Influentials in einem virtuellen sozialen Netzwerk.},

	abstract = {Attempts to quantify the numbers of migrants generated by changes in climate have commonly been calculated by projecting physical climate changes on an exposed population. These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change.},

We also discuss two challenges that hamper the widespread use of ABM in the study of migration and, more broadly, demography and the social sciences: (a) the choice and the operationalisation of a behavioural theory (decision-making and social interaction) and (b) the selection of empirical evidence to validate the model.

Specifically, this contribution examines the effectiveness of a simulation based on different recycling behaviors to better understand the phenomenon. The perspective used takes into consideration the recycling attitude and the sensitivity to social norms based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to predict recycling outcomes. As a whole, this paper highlights the dominance of dynamics and interacting aspects of waste management for the formulation of effective recycling public policies based on behavioral aspects. In addition, it illustrates how it is possible to use such empirical models as the Structural Equation Models (SEM) as a starting point for developing ABM simulations that are closer to both theory and reality.},

In their respective aggregates, behavioral beliefs produce a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the behavior; normative beliefs result in perceived social pressure or subjective norm; and control beliefs give rise to perceived behavioral control. In combination, attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perception of behavioral control lead to the formation of a behavioral intention. As a general rule, the more favorable the attitude and subjective norm, and the greater the perceived control, the stronger should be the person's intention to perform the behavior in question. Finally, given a sufficient degree of actual control over the behavior, people are expected to carry out their intentions when the opportunity arises. Intention is thus assumed to be the immediate antecedent of behavior. However, because many behaviors pose difficulties of execution that may limit volitional control, it is useful to consider perceived behavioral control in addition to intention. To the extent that perceived behavioral control is veridical, it can serve as a proxy for actual control and contribute to the prediction of the behavior in question. The following figure is a schematic representation of the theory.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) techniques for studying human-technical systems face two important challenges. First, agent behavioral rules are often ad hoc, making it difficult to assess the implications of these models within the larger theoretical context. Second, the lack of relevant empirical data precludes many models from being appropriately initialized and validated, limiting the value of such models for exploring emergent properties or for policy evaluation. To address these issues, in this paper we present a theoretically-based and empirically-driven agent-based model of technology adoption, with an application to residential solar photovoltaic (PV). Using household-level resolution for demographic, attitudinal, social network, and environmental variables, the integrated ABM framework we develop is applied to real-world data covering 2004–2013 for a residential solar PV program at the city scale. Two applications of the model focusing on rebate program design are also presented.},

	abstract = {Innovation diffusion has been studied extensively in a variety of disciplines, including sociology, economics, marketing, ecology, and computer science. Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions.},
